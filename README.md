# Navier-Stokes-integration
Approaching a Fluid dynamics exam I feel the urge to put to trial what I am learning.
For my first  time I am visualizing the results of the simulation with `Paraview`. I'm in love with it.
To visualize the videos go in "relation/immagini_presentazione/".
I wrote "\relation\main.pdf" for my fluid dynamics exam: in there is a good synthesis of what I have done.
